We have worked on different models based on Question Answering System (a university chatbot). 

The first one is doc2vec model, that works on similarity basis, the code for which can be found on Doc2VecModel.ipynb. The system answers to the question of user by choosing the answer of most similar question placed in the data.

The second one is end to end memory netwok, a generative model that is based on two parts/sub-models. The first part of this model extracts keywords from a question asked by user, while the other part generates a sentence from the extracted keywords.
